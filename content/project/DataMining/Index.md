title: Data Mining
summary: This assignment is about implementation of KNN algorithm with the hyper parameters K values =1,3,5,7 and distance metrics = euclidean distance , euclidean distance and cosine distance
Split the data of IRIS into development and test set
Find the optimal parameters using development data set and plot them using barchart for the given hyperparameters
Analyse the graph and get optimal hyperparameters, and from the hyperparameters getting the Final accuracy of test-set
